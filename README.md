### Data transformation and data preparation
The data was taken from the Microsoft sample data and was extracted using SQL server into csv files to use them in the Power BI dashboard.

Date_table was used to retrieve dates about the performances of the sales through time

Sales_table, product_table and customer_table show information about sales, products and customers in that order
